# Game ðŸŽ®

## Fragment
Connects the UI Controller with the data we're providing. Once the game is over (timer runs out), it passes the game score into the `ScoreFragment`.

## ViewModel
Generates the puzzle, tells the `GridView` which words are being used and contains a timer to keep track of the game.
